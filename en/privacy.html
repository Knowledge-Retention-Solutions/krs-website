        <p>
          The responsible party for data processing on this website is:

          52078 Aachen<br>

        <p>
          Email: <a href="mailto:info@knowledge-retention-solutions.de">info@knowledge-retention-solutions.de</a>
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-lg">Storage Duration</h3>
        <p>
          Unless a more specific storage period has been mentioned within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate deletion request or revoke consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-lg">General Information on Legal Bases of Data Processing on This Website</h3>
        <p>
          If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR, if special categories of data according to Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR are processed. In case of express consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also carried out on the basis of Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to access information on your device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing is additionally carried out on the basis of § 25 para. 1 TTDSG. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for contract fulfillment or for the execution of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if this is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR. Data processing can also be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The relevant legal bases in each individual case are informed in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-lg">Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
        <p>
          Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent already given at any time. The legality of data processing carried out until revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-lg">Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
        <p>
          IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME, FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION, TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES TO ASSERT, EXERCISE OR DEFEND LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).
        </p>
        <p>
          IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-lg">Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
        <p>
          In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work, or the place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-lg">Right to Data Portability</h3>
        <p>
          You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request direct transfer of data to another controller, this will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-lg">Information, Correction and Deletion</h3>
        <p>
          Within the framework of applicable legal provisions, you have the right to free information at any time about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient, and the purpose of data processing and, if applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this and other questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-lg">Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
        <p>
          You have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data. For this, you can contact us at any time. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-left: var(--space-lg); list-style: disc;">
          <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
          <li>If the processing of your personal data has been/is unlawful, you can request restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</li>
          <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
          <li>If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data may – apart from storage – only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-xl">4. Data Collection on This Website</h2>

        <h3 class="mt-lg">Server Log Files</h3>
        <p>
          The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-left: var(--space-lg); list-style: disc;">
          <li>Browser type and browser version</li>
          <li>Operating system used</li>
          <li>Referrer URL</li>
          <li>Host name of the accessing computer</li>
          <li>Time of server request</li>
          <li>IP address</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This data is not merged with other data sources.
        </p>
        <p>
          This data is collected on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimization of its website – for this purpose, server log files must be collected.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-lg">Contact by Email</h3>
        <p>
          If you contact us by email, your inquiry including all resulting personal data (name, email address, inquiry) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We will not pass on this data without your consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          This data is processed on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR if your inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of inquiries addressed to us (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) if this was requested.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data you send to us by email will remain with us until you request deletion, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after your request has been processed). Mandatory statutory provisions – in particular retention periods – remain unaffected.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-xl">5. External Services</h2>
